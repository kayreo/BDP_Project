Character List: Player, Dr. Avery DeWitt, MUS-L

(wrrrrr) (wrrrr) (wrrrr)

The sounds of rocks break and chip against a large metal drill, dropping somewhere into the pool of darkness below. A crew of three humanoid individuals stare out into a massive darkened cavern; their eyes slowly adjusting to the shadowed chamber. A warm and sweet breeze blows lightly against the figures and the air feels humid and damp. The silhouetted individual in the front leans further out into the dark, searching for any sign of light. They lean even further; before saying something to their companions. As they turn they lose their footing, slipping down onto the rocks and quickly falling, falling, falling, until!

(SPLASH)

Screen goes dark

Familiar Voice (Scientist): “Captain! (Robot) quick, help me pull her out! We don’t even know if this is normal water!”

Familiar Voice (Robot): “I agree, this water is too abnormally saturated to be considered normal. The captain will need a full scan to determine any injuries or changes in her bodily structure.”

The screen slowly fades in revealing the cavernous background, waterfall, and the speaking figures. The water shines with a vibrant almost neon blue against the purple stone walls and dark velvet and purple trees and roots. The trees give a slight glow and hum like fireflies and illuminate the surrounding cavern and grassy gnoll.

Scientist: “Oh thank goodness, MUS-L you run diagnostics and I’ll make sure the Captain didn’t suffer any memory loss.”

(Player: Thoughts) I...remember this person. Her name is Dr. Avery DeWitt and she is a part of my crew. She’s our chief scientist and medical expert.

MUS-L: “Running diagnostics now...this may take a while, Dr.DeWitt. I will deploy temporary guard mode while waiting until the diagnostics check is complete.”

MUS-L begins to emit a blue wave of light that starts looking me up and down while he turns to face the strange purple and red forest.

(Player: Thoughts) I...remember them too thankfully. It’s MUS-L, our personal Manual Unconditional Service Loader. He’s our bot sent by AstroCorp to assist in the mining and protection of the crew.

Player: “Yes Dr. DeWitt, MUS-L, I feel fine. Probably just gave me a bad bruise is all.”

MUL-T: “Diagnostics is complete: the captain is correct. Only minor injuries were sustained. Life support systems are fully functioning. Glad to see you’re not terminated, Captain.”
Dr. DeWitt: “Oh MUS-L, we talked about this! Avoid using the t-word whenever something bad like this happens it can be insensitive.”

MUS-L (beeping sadly): “I...apologize Captain. I will categorize this information in my deep storage memory banks to permanently retain this for later. I told myself to be better than this.”

Player: “Oh MUS-L relax. Nothing bad happened and you were during as you were directed you have no reason to feel down. Okay, so what’s the situation? Give me a rundown again of everything we know.”

Dr. DeWitt: “Yes Captain, currently not much has changed from our standard mission. Our job from AstroCorp was to investigate and assist in the terraforming process for planet X-43 in the Hollow Mire system. We arrived approximately 12 hours ago; told by the corporation that other drilling operations and machinery have been damaged by strange dead plant roots that the world burrow from underground. Only we three were sent to investigate while the rest of the remaining personal wait aboard our ship ready to assist in getting us away should our lives be in danger. We have gone down through the previous holes left by the machines to continue digging with small equipment and now...we’ve brought you back from falling from the hole we just fell through.”

Player: “Alright, well are you two alright? We can’t continue investigating...whatever this weird forest is unless you two are ready to get moving.”

MUS-L: “Oh I have sustained no serious injuries Captain.”

Dr. DeWitt: “I am fine as well. I’m just nervous about all of this. It’s beautiful but at the same time I can’t help but feel like we’re in a bit of a bind.”

Player: “Well, for now, let’s just focus on what we can control. MUS-L, the water that you mentioned before. Scan it, I wanna know if that glow is just for show. Dr. DeWitt, plan on getting soil and samples of nearby trees for analysis. We can use my- wait. Where’s my datapad?”

Dr. DeWitt: “Oh,  I almost forgot! Captain, here you are; it fell off your belt on the way down. I’ll get started on the samples and then we can try and use the pad to contact the ship.”

MUS-L: “Roger Roger, Captain. I will report back with any updates regarding the contents of the water.”

The doctor quickly begins taking out various tools and scoops small piles of dirt while being careful to scrape off any of the plant matter from the roots. MUS-L begins to walk over to the waterfall that contains the large glowing body of water to begin studying it with his large metal eye.

Player (thoughts): Alright, now I just need to pull up our holographic test kit and see what we can learn.

You look fondly at the chips and dents in its casing. A great deal of use has gone into using this pad ever since it was given to you

Player (thoughts): Oh no...no, no, no. Why the hell can’t I remember my pass number!? We’re screwed if I can’t get this thing booted on; we could be trapped here without any way to know what we’re dealing with. Wait, didn’t MUS-L have a spare code somewhere?

The screen then shows the back of MUS-L’s robotic form. Multiple different scraps and scrapes are covered on his body. There also appears to be a sticky note stapled to his chest.

Player (thoughts): Oh...that’s right, gotta remember to take that off!

The player has then prompted to input the code by looking at the sticky note from the visual clue on MUS-L. They pass and fail depending on user input. After they succeed…

The datapad flickers to life and showcases a wide array of conditions of the crew as well as displays what current notes/objects are contained within and on hand.

Player: “Ah, now we’re cooking! MUS-L, Doctor, you got anything you can give me about this place?”

(I was thinking for this a way to showcase the different choices you can make is choosing which information to get from which character first. Let me know what you think.)

Dr. DeWitt: (confused): “Well, this specific plant type and soil structure are unlike anything I’ve ever seen in previous studies and analysis of other planets. The plant matter appears to (says grossly)...ungulate when disturbed; the soil is full of rich nutrients that also cause rapid growth of the plant matter I’ve observed.”

Player: “Huh, I guess that makes this trip so far somewhat of a success and an unfortunate failure. Great stuff to potentially grow grass and edible plants with but so far underground makes it not ideal. MUS-L, got anything on the water yet?”

MUS-L: “Affirmative Captain. My scans indicate that the water at present in this section underground is nearly entirely saturated with carbon dioxide as well as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. The chemical makeup of the liquid, strange as it is, could theoretically be produced by other plant life on current organic plant data at a .0001% odds of success with enough roots and chloroplasts.”

Dr. DeWitt: “MUS-L, you can’t be serious. Even if it were possible that would mean that...”

Dr. DeWitt then looks at the water, then to the forest, then to the large cavernous ceiling. MUS-L’s light flashes at low, dim brightness, his body humming which echoes throughout the cave. Their silence concerning, their body language stiff and still.

Player: “Doctor, MUS-L; what did you guys figure out? We haven’t got all day to stand stunned.”

They both turn to face each other nervously, then towards me and begin to explain…

MUS-L: “The only logical connection that can be formed with our understanding of data is that the entire planet is one central organic life form.”

Player: “I’m sorry, are you saying we’re currently attempting to terraform a plant the size of a planet?!”

Dr. DeWitt: “I’m afraid so...however, this would explain the damage to previous attempts made at drilling. The plant is trying to protect some of its most dense but vital areas that support its life. The fact that it can do that though and is so massive is extremely troubling.”

MUS-L: “Observing current data though, this plant is vitally tied to everything here and with its soil and water that it produces could potentially be used as a resource for future operations. Also, our drill was not blocked off. This data point could be assumed to mean small team operations could be done at a slower pace to come down here.”

Player: “I’m...not sure what this is going to mean everyone but be certain that as captain of this crew our mission has now changed. We need to learn more about...whatever this thing is and fast so we can figure out our next steps moving forward.”

Dr. DeWitt: “I suggest then that we get moving towards this nearby thicket then Captain. It would lead more into the woodwork so we could further analyze and observe any data on the vegetation and its rapid growth effects. (looking uncomfortably) Also, being out in this open space leaves me feeling rather exposed.”

MUS-L: “Captain, if I may suggest an alternate route? This water’s special properties must lead to some sort of source deeper into possibly a location of an area of localized routes. (boops excitedly) I also am...interested in how this water could be potentially used to better our terraforming process on the surface.”

Dr. DrWitt: “No matter which way we start; we’ll stick together Captain. I don’t think going at it alone is a great idea right now…”

MUS-L: “Affirmative, the potentiality of injuring one’s self when travelling an alien underground forest could be estimated near a startling percentile?”

Captain: “You have data on this from the corporation MUS-L?”

MUS-L: (boop laughter) “I was just attempting a joke; was it not funny?”

Dr.DeWitt: (slightly chuckling) “It was certainly an... attempt MUS-L.”

Player (thoughts): Hmm, a potential water source or a stronger and more localized area of the vegetation. We’ll most likely be able to get to both as long as nothing goes wrong but which direction would be best to start?



The player is then given the choice to move into the thicket or towards the direction past the waterfall. Either direction will lead to the other area after the first is visited.

Chapter 2:
(For this section I’ll be starting Ch. 2 as the thicket and Ch. 2 as the water source area since it helps form an easier flow when writing.)

Player: “I think you’re right Doctor, we need to keep moving before anything else out of the ordinary finds us sitting around. MUS-L, if we have time I’m sure we’ll be able to make our way back to the source of the water.”

MUS-L: “I will keep my hope modules at a reasonable expectation Captain.”

Dr. DeWitt: “I think this is going to be the start of a potential way inside the forest Captain. Let’s go through here!”

(Wipe to black for commentary)

We make our way through the forest’s opening; the wetness in the air causing an immediate sense of a jungle seeping with moisture. The dark violet earth crunching against the bottoms of our feet. The trees become thicker and denser as we pass over large roots and vines. We walk like this for a while, MUS-L, and Dr.DeWitt occasionally commenting on the strangeness of this bizarre place we’ve found ourselves in.

(Fade into the thicker background of the treeline, the large structure in the middle immediately apparent in the background.)
We begin to pass deeper into the forest; the darkness split between the leaves, vines, and trees turning a once bio-luminescent warm cave into a very dark and dense mass of tall, strange trees. In the cave there were some scattered about and were much smaller; but, due to the datapad and Dr.DeWitt’s tools picking up a much stronger reading of biological importance we left without an up-close analysis Now though...the slick and glistening violet bark; magenta tinted vines intertwined with strange vertically propped branches forming conular bundles atop the treeline.
